#Week 1: Management Accounting
What is management accounting?	Providing/analyzing financial information for internal use <b>by managers</b> for planning, control, cost management and better decision-making.
How does management accounting differ from financial accounting?	Management accounting seeks to meet the needs of managers (more specific/detailed), whereas financial accounting focuses on recording transactions and preparing financial statements for external users.
What are the four principles of management accounting?	<b>1. Influence</b> - communication of information influences management decisions<br><b>2. Relevance</b> - information guides decision-making that affects the future<br><b>3. Analysis</b> - assess impact of options on performance/value<br><b>4. Trust</b> - accountants need to be trustworthy
What is the trade-off in providing management accounting information?	Management accounting information should only be produced if the cost of providing it is less than the benefits derived from its use. There's an optimal amount of information where the gap between cost and value is greatest.
What are the features of a management accounting information system?	<b>1. Identifying and capturing</b> relevant information<br><b>2. Recording</b> information in a systematic manner<br><b>3. Analyzing and interpreting</b> the information<br><b>4. Reporting</b> information to suit managers' needs
What are the six areas where management accounting information plays an important role?	<b>1. Formulating objectives and strategies</b><br><b>2. Performance evaluation and control</b><br><b>3. Resource management</b><br><b>4. Investment appraisal and control</b><br><b>5. Determining costs and benefits</b><br><b>6. Cost management and control</b>
What is the definition of cost?	The amount paid for goods supplied or the service provided. Cost represents the resources sacrificed in order to achieve benefits.

#Week 2: Full Costing
What is full (absorption) costing?	Full costing takes account of all costs of producing a product or service, including both direct and indirect costs. It's the total amount of resources sacrificed to achieve a given objective.
What are the four main uses of full cost information?	<b>1. Pricing and output decisions</b><br><b>2. Exercising control</b><br><b>3. Assessing relative efficiency</b><br><b>4. Assessing performance</b>
What is process costing?	A method used for single-product businesses where the total manufacturing cost is averaged over the number of units produced by summing all elements of production cost and dividing by total units of output.
What is job costing?	An approach used for multi-product businesses that accumulates costs for each individual unit of output by identifying direct costs and assigning a share of indirect costs (overheads) to determine full cost.
What is the difference between direct cost and indirect cost?	<b>Direct cost</b>: Cost clearly associated with specific cost units that can be measured reliably (e.g., direct materials, direct labor)<br><b>Indirect cost (overheads)</b>: Cost that cannot be identified with each particular cost unit (e.g., rent)
How are overhead costs typically assigned to products?	Through overhead absorption (recovery) rates such as:<br>- Percentage of direct labor cost<br>- Percentage of direct materials<br>- Direct labor hour rate<br>- Machine hour rate<br>The selection depends on the nature of operations/activities
What's the difference between variable/direct costs and fixed/indirect costs?	Variable and fixed costs are defined in terms of cost behavior when activity volume changes. Direct and indirect costs are defined by how they can be identified with particular cost units. A cost can be indirect yet variable, or direct yet fixed.
What factors should be considered when selecting an appropriate method of charging overheads?	<b>1.</b> It is a matter of judgment based on the circumstances/context<br><b>2.</b> For capital-intensive production with machine-based overheads, use machine hours<br><b>3.</b> For labor-intensive operations, use direct labor hours<br><b>4.</b> Different cost centers may use different overhead absorption rates based on their nature

#Week 3: Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis
What are fixed costs?	Costs that remain constant (fixed) when changes occur to volume of activity (e.g., rent paid for premises).
What are variable costs?	Costs that vary according to volume of activity and are typically the same per unit regardless of output volume (e.g., cost of raw materials).
What is break-even analysis?	A technique to find the point where total sales revenue equals total cost (fixed + variable), resulting in neither profit nor loss.
How is the break-even point calculated?	Break-even point (units) = Fixed costs รท Contribution per unit<br>Where contribution per unit = Sales revenue per unit - Variable cost per unit
What is contribution?	The excess of sales revenue over variable cost. It's called contribution because it contributes to meeting fixed costs first, and then to profit if there's any excess.
What is contribution margin ratio?	The contribution from an activity expressed as a percentage of sales revenue.<br>Contribution margin ratio = (Contribution per unit รท Sales revenue per unit) ร 100%
What is margin of safety?	The difference between the target sales level and the break-even point. The larger the margin of safety, the less risk there is of making a loss.
How do you calculate the volume of activity needed to achieve a target profit?	Units needed = (Fixed costs + Target profit) รท Contribution per unit
In what four areas can marginal analysis be used for decision-making?	<b>1. Pricing/assessing opportunities to enter contracts</b><br><b>2. Determining efficient use of scarce resources</b><br><b>3. Make-or-buy decisions</b><br><b>4. Closing or continuation decisions</b>
Why is marginal analysis only used for short-term decisions?	Because it ignores fixed costs, assuming they aren't affected by the decision. This is only valid in the short term, as fixed costs will eventually change with major long-term decisions.
What is marginal analysis?	A form of cost-benefit analysis that compares additional costs of a particular activity with additional benefits it generates. Only costs and revenues that vary with the decision are considered.
What are the weaknesses of break-even analysis?	<b>1. Non-linear relationships</b> - cost/revenue lines aren't always straight<br><b>2. Stepped fixed costs</b> - most fixed costs aren't fixed over the entire range of activity<br><b>3. Multi-product businesses</b> - sales of one product may affect sales of another

#Week 4: Activity-Based Costing (ABC)
What is activity-based costing (ABC)?	A costing approach that traces the cost of all activities supporting the production process and links these costs to particular units of output, providing a more realistic account of overhead costs.
What are the key components of activity-based costing?	<b>Cost drivers</b>: Factors that cause a change in the costs of each support activity<br><b>Cost pools</b>: Areas of support activity to which overhead costs are assigned
What is the ABC process?	<b>1.</b> Identify different activities of the business<br><b>2.</b> Create cost pools by calculating total cost of each activity<br><b>3.</b> Identify a cost driver for each activity<br><b>4.</b> Calculate cost driver rate<br><b>5.</b> Attach activity costs to products based on their demand for each activity
What are the main differences between ABC and traditional costing?	<b>Traditional</b>: Assigns overheads to product cost centers (departments), then to outputs using rates like labor/machine hours<br><b>ABC</b>: Assigns overheads to cost pools (activities), then charges to outputs using specific cost driver rates for each activity
What are the limitations of ABC?	<b>1.</b> Time-consuming and costly to implement<br><b>2.</b> Some costs may apply to more than one cost pool<br><b>3.</b> Cost pools can have more than one cost driver<br><b>4.</b> Not suitable for all businesses, especially those with simple products and stable markets
What is a cost driver?	A factor that causes a change in the costs of a support activity. It has a cause-and-effect relationship with activity costs and is used as the basis for assigning support activity costs to particular units of output.
What is a cost pool?	The sum of the overhead costs that are seen as being caused by the same cost driver. It's an area of support activity to which overhead costs are assigned (equivalent to cost centers).

#Week 5: Relevant Costs for Decision Making
What criteria must a cost meet to be considered relevant to a decision?	<b>1.</b> It must relate to the objective of the business<br><b>2.</b> It must be a future cost<br><b>3.</b> It must vary with the decision
What are opportunity costs?	The cost incurred when pursuing one course of action prevents an opportunity to derive some benefit from another course of action.
What are outlay costs?	The amount of money that will have to be spent to achieve an objective.
What are irrelevant costs in decision-making?	<b>1.</b> All past (sunk) costs<br><b>2.</b> All committed costs<br><b>3.</b> Non-differential future outlay costs
What is the sunk cost fallacy?	The irrational commitment to past costs due to previous investment of time, effort or money, resulting in poor decisions about future direction.
What is cost-benefit analysis?	A systematic process of weighing the cost of pursuing some objective against the benefits it is likely to generate, to help decide whether to proceed. For a proposed plan to be economically viable, the likely benefits should exceed the additional costs.
What are committed costs?	Costs incurred that have not yet been paid, but which must be paid as a result of some existing contract or obligation.
How do you determine the relevant cost for materials?	It will vary according to whether:<br>- the materials are held in inventory or need to be purchased<br>- the materials need to be replaced if taken from inventory<br>- there is an alternative use for the materials

#Week 6: Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)
What are the four methods of investment appraisal?	<b>1. Accounting rate of return (ARR)</b><br><b>2. Payback period (PP)</b><br><b>3. Net present value (NPV)</b><br><b>4. Internal rate of return (IRR)</b>
How is Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) calculated?	ARR = (Average annual operating profit after depreciation รท Average investment) ร 100%<br>Where:<br>- Average investment = (Initial investment + Residual value) รท 2
What are the decision rules for ARR?	- Project must achieve a target ARR as minimum to be acceptable<br>- Select the project with highest ARR if multiple projects achieve the target<br>- The greater the ARR, the more attractive the project
What is Payback Period (PP) and how is it used?	Payback Period is the time taken for an initial investment to be repaid from net cash inflows. For a project to be acceptable, it should have a PP no longer than the maximum period set by the business. The shorter the PP, the more attractive the project.
What are the limitations of Payback Period?	- Doesn't relate to shareholders' wealth<br>- Doesn't consider required rate of return<br>- Ignores cash inflows after the payback date<br>- Takes little account of timing of cash flows<br>- Ignores much relevant information
What is Net Present Value (NPV)?	The sum of discounted values of net cash flows from an investment. It considers all cash flows and makes a logical allowance for their timing.
What is the formula for calculating present value?	PV = Future cash flow รท (1 + r)^n<br>Where:<br>- r is the discount rate (opportunity cost of finance)<br>- n is the year of cash flow
What are the decision rules for NPV?	- If NPV is negative: investment will not meet expectations<br>- If NPV is exactly 0: investment will meet expectations<br>- If NPV is positive: investment will exceed expectations (enhance wealth)
What are the benefits of using NPV for investment appraisal?	- Takes account of timing of cash flows<br>- Includes all relevant cash flows<br>- Directly relates to business objective of enhancing owners' wealth<br>- Provides clear signals and is practical<br>- Takes all relevant information into account
What is Internal Rate of Return (IRR)?	The discount rate that, when applied to projected future cash flows, produces a zero NPV. It represents the yield or percentage return from an investment opportunity.
What are the decision rules for IRR?	- Projects with IRR greater than cost of capital are acceptable<br>- The greater the IRR, the more attractive the project
What are the problems with IRR?	- Doesn't directly address wealth generation<br>- Ignores scale of investment<br>- Difficulty handling projects with unconventional cash flows<br>- Can result in multiple IRRs or no IRR<br>- Difficult to use in practice
Why does money have a time value in investment decisions?	Due to factors like:<br><b>1. Interest lost</b> - money today could earn interest<br><b>2. Risk</b> - future outcomes are uncertain<br><b>3. Inflation</b> - purchasing power of money decreases over time

#Week 7: Budgeting and Financial Planning
What is a budget?	A budget sets out short-term business plans, expressed in financial terms, to translate long-term strategic plans into an actionable blueprint for the immediate future.
What is the relationship between strategic planning and budgeting?	Budgets are an integral part of the planning and control process, linking to strategic plans and objectives. They translate long-term strategic goals into specific financial targets for the short term (usually one year).
What is a master budget?	A summary of individual operating budgets comprising the budgeted Income Statement, budgeted Balance Sheet, statement of financial position, and budget cash flow statement.
What is a variance in budgeting?	The difference between actual results and budgeted results. If feedback is worse than budget, it gives an adverse variance; if better than budget, it gives a favorable variance.
What is the difference between periodic and continual budgets?	<b>Periodic budgets</b>: Prepared for a particular period (usually 1 year) as a one-off exercise<br><b>Continual (rolling) budgets</b>: Continuously updated by adding a new month to replace the month that has passed
What are the benefits of budgeting?	<b>1.</b> Promotes forward thinking and identifies short-term problems<br><b>2.</b> Helps coordination between sections of the business<br><b>3.</b> Motivates managers to better performance<br><b>4.</b> Provides a basis for control<br><b>5.</b> Provides a system of authorization for spending
What are the steps to set a budget?	<b>1.</b> Establish responsibilities<br><b>2.</b> Communicate budget guidelines<br><b>3.</b> Identify limiting factors<br><b>4.</b> Prepare budget for limiting factor area<br><b>5.</b> Prepare draft budgets for other areas<br><b>6.</b> Review and coordinate budgets<br><b>7.</b> Prepare master budget<br><b>8.</b> Communicate budgets<br><b>9.</b> Monitor performance
What is incremental budgeting?	A method of budget setting based on what happened in the previous period, with some adjustment for expected changes (e.g., inflation). It starts with last year's figures and adds for inflation.
What is zero-based budgeting (ZBB)?	A budgeting approach where all spending must be justified and each new budget period starts with a blank sheet (zero-base). Budget will only increase above zero if a good case can be made for allocating resources to an activity.
What are the criticisms of conventional budgeting?	<b>1.</b> Cannot deal with rapid change<br><b>2.</b> Focus on short-term financial targets<br><b>3.</b> Encourage top-down management<br><b>4.</b> Time-consuming<br><b>5.</b> Based around traditional functions<br><b>6.</b> Encourage incremental thinking<br><b>7.</b> Protect rather than lower costs<br><b>8.</b> Promote 'sharp' practice among managers
What is commitment accounting?	The process of being able to view not only all invoiced costs in the budgeting system but also committed costs (costs that have been committed to expenditure but not yet invoiced or paid for).
What is a limiting factor in budgeting?	An aspect of the business (e.g., lack of sales demand) that prevents it from achieving its objectives to the maximum extent. Limiting factors must be identified as most budgets will be affected by them.
What are the "3 Es" in budgeting and resource management?	<b>Efficiency</b>: How well activities are carried out<br><b>Effectiveness</b>: How well targets and outputs are hit<br><b>Economy</b>: How resources are consumed in undertaking activities

#Week 8: Accounting for Control
What is the difference between feedback and feedforward control?	<b>Feedback control</b>: Compares actual with planned performance and takes action after divergence occurs (remedial)<br><b>Feedforward control</b>: Compares forecast future performance with plan and takes action before problems arise (preventative)
What is "flexing the budget"?	Revising the budget based on different volume of output by knowing which revenues/costs are fixed and variable. It allows more valid comparisons between budget and actual results to identify variances.
What are the main types of sales variances?	<b>1. Sales volume variance</b>: Difference between original and flexed budget profit figures<br><b>2. Sales price variance</b>: Difference between actual sales revenue and flexed budget sales revenue
What are the main material variances?	<b>1. Direct materials usage variance</b>: Difference between quantity of materials in flexed budget and actual quantity used, multiplied by budgeted cost per unit<br><b>2. Direct materials price variance</b>: Difference between actual cost of materials used and cost allowed (actual quantity at budgeted cost)
What are the main labor variances?	<b>1. Direct labor efficiency variance</b>: Difference between hours budgeted for actual production and actual hours taken, at budgeted rate<br><b>2. Direct labor rate variance</b>: Difference between actual hours at budgeted rate and actual labor cost
What is a standard costing system?	A system that sets out the standard cost of doing something, measures actual costs, compares them with standards, and highlights differences (variances) to improve planning and cost control.
What is the difference between ideal standards and practical standards?	<b>Ideal standards</b>: Assume perfect operating conditions with no inefficiency<br><b>Practical standards</b>: Do not assume perfect conditions but take account of possible lost time and defects while still being challenging
What is the learning-curve effect in standard costing?	The effect where routine tasks are performed more quickly with experience, resulting in improved efficiency over time. Important to consider when setting standards and interpreting labor efficiency variances.
What are the limitations of standard costing?	<b>1.</b> Standards can quickly become outdated<br><b>2.</b> Factors may affect a variance that a manager can't control<br><b>3.</b> Difficult to create clear responsibility lines<br><b>4.</b> No incentive to improve once standard is met<br><b>5.</b> May create incentives for undesirable behavior
How do you calculate the fixed overhead spending variance?	The difference between the flexed (or original) budget and actual figures for fixed overhead costs.
What is the relationship between budgeted and actual profit?	Budgeted profit + Favorable variances - Adverse variances = Actual profit
